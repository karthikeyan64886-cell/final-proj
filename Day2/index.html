        <dt><strong>coffee</strong></dt>
        <dd>Black coffee is coffee brewed with hot water, minus milk, cream, or sugar, offering antioxidants, caffeine, 
            and potential benefits like improved heart/brain health, weight management, and athletic performance, made from 
            roasted beans. It's a calorie-free drink, enjoyed hot or cold, with a range of flavors depending on the bean and roast,
             and can be made with instant powder or fresh grounds. </dd>

        <dd>At the time of the Spanish Armada in 1588, the daily allowance on board a Royal Navy ship was one pound of biscuit plus
         one gallon of beer. Samuel Pepys in 1667 first regularised naval victualling with varied and nutritious rations.
          Royal Navy hardtack during Queen Victoria's reign was made by machine at the Royal Clarence Victualling Yard at Gosport, 
          Hampshire, stamped with the Queen's mark and the number of the oven in which they were baked. When machinery was introduced 
          into the process the dough was thoroughly mixed and rolled into sheets about 2 yards (1.8 m) long and 1 yard (0.9 m) wide 
          which were stamped in one stroke into about sixty hexagonal-shaped biscuits. This left the sheets sufficiently coherent to 
          be placed in the oven in one piece and when baked they were easy to separate. The hexagonal shape rather than traditional
          circular biscuits meant a saving in material and was easier to pack.[11] Biscuits remained an important part of the
           Royal Navy sailor's diet until the introduction of canned foods. Canned meat was first marketed in 1814; preserved beef 
           in tins was officially added to Royal Navy rations in 1847 <sup>[8]</sup>. </dd>
